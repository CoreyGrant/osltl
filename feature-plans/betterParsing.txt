Multiple upgrades to parsing have been added
However, there are still many issues which will need to be manually fixed
Easiest way to do this is to also generate a list of tasks which we know have some issue about them.
Several heuristics to detect this.
    The same skill being set multiple times
    The words either/or in the body of the text
    Can also maintain a manual list of tasks we know need manual changes, via id/name

Also need to remove some set of links which aren't relevant, can maintain a blacklist for these
