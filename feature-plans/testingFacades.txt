Need a good way to test the user details api for different completed tasks and skill sets
Currently the league_tasks list is always empty, because there is no current leagues
Need to be able to mock and test changes to the list of completed tasks, to check behavior around task completion removing from personal task list, prebuilt tasks etc.
